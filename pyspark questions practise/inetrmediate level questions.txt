Data Aggregation and Transformation
Compute the total and average sales revenue per region and product for the last three months in the dataset.

Find the top 5 employees by total quantity sold (after joining employees and sales).

Calculate the month-over-month growth in total sales revenue, using window functions for analysis.

Identify products where average order quantity is above the overall mean, grouped by product.

Data Cleaning and Type Handling
Identify and handle missing or invalid values in numeric columns such as Salary, Quantity, and UnitPrice.

Standardize department names in employees (e.g., merge "HR" and "Human Resources" if both exist).

Detect and report inconsistent date or data formats, then convert them into a uniform format.

Join Operations and Performance
Perform a left join between employees and sales, returning all employees plus their total sales (zero if no sales).

Implement a broadcast join where appropriate, and explain when this is optimal.

Advanced Window Functions
Use window functions to assign a rank to employees based on their total revenue generated (descending), partitioned by department.

Calculate the running total of revenue per region by date.

Data Engineering and Optimization
Demonstrate how you would partition the sales data optimally for distributed processing, and explain your choice.

Explain or show with code how to cache and un-cache DataFrames when reusing them for multiple transformations.

Real-World Workflow Scenarios
You are given a new CSV of “employee awards” (EmployeeID, AwardType, AwardDate). Integrate this with your main employee DataFrame for analytics.

Create a pipeline to incrementally process daily sales files as they arrive in a directory, only appending new records.

Quality and Anomaly Detection
Find employees with suspicious sales activity (e.g., unusually high average order amount compared to peers in the same department).

Identify and remove duplicate records in both employees and sales datasets.
